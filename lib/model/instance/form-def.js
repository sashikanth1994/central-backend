// FormDefs are the concrete definitions behind logical Forms; this includes the
// blob of XML that define what a form is, along with some fields that are extracted
// out of that XML for perf caching and some form versioning metadata like the
// creation time and the schema transformation id.
//
// The biggest bit of work this Instance class does is to parse a given XForms
// XML string and if it is valid to pull out values we will need later, like its
// formId and MD5 hash.
//
// It also provides convenience entrypoints to the schema information returned by
// lib/data/schema.js.
